# Handshake with @liaugminaite

This is your first **markdown** document. This is a bit confusing.  In the markdown language `#` stands for heading 1, `##` for heading 2, `###` for heading three. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# This is a separated are with your first R code.
# You load the 'here' library first. It makes sure that file paths are treated consistently across
# Windows, Mac and Unix/Linux systems
# The hasmark is still for comments.
library(here)
# This a code that will be used to translate this document to pdf or epub.
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

If you want to leave a comment for yourself (or to ask for help), you use the following notation

`<!---`
`Your comments between the start and end comment will not be read by the computer. If you translate this document to PDF, WORD, MD [it's all one click!] the commented out lines will not be visible. But they are visible in the Rmd source file. `
`--->`

<!---
You see, this is not visible in the final output, only here.

## Hello, world!

Good afternoon! 

## Add a file to the png folder

Choose any png file that you like (and which is royalty free, not too big), and place it on your drive to the `/png/subfolder` of your local repository copy. The name of the png file should be changed below:

```{r yourpng, eval=TRUE}
# By the way this is how you include a png file as illustration from 
# ../png/<your_filename>.png
knitr::include_graphics(here("png", "1200px-Sunflower_sky_backdrop.jpg"))
```

Please read the [entire covenant here](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/).

## A bit of housekeeping
You will need the devtools R package and the RTools extension to your already installed R system, and you should be working with RStudio.

### Get your computer ready 

- [x] You will need the crossplatform Java programming environment on your computer. It is cross-platform and facilitates the use of Linux, BSD/Mac OX and Windows collaboration.  You most probably have it.  It is a good opportunity to check if you have the latest version. If not, do upgrade, both for security and functionality reasons, and at the same time remove the old versions. Follow this link <https://www.java.com/en/download/>.

### Install R and some critical components

- [x] If you recently installed R, you most likely have the latest version. If not, then run `install.packages(“installr”)` and run `installr::check.for.updates.R()`.  If there is a newer R release, you should upgrade. `installr::updateR()` will take you through the progress, including the moving of your already installed packages to the new R installation, however, it will not remove the old R environment. You should run the upgrader from the R GUI (you will find this somewhere on your computer, even though you may have forgotten about it because you always use R from RStudio.)

- [ ] In my experience, the copying of the old R packages is not always successful. You can prepare for this by saving the list of installed packages before your 
I do not my reinstalling though my packages. It reminds me to remove detritus, and review my own developments.  

- [x] One package that is worth running at all new installs is tinytex. `tinytex::reinstall_tinytex()` or `tinytex::install_tinytex()`. [Tinytex](https://yihui.org/tinytex/) is a lightweight tex engine, and it will allow many tex libraries from [CTAN](https://ctan.org/?lang=en), such as fonts, formatting tools for TeX, and so on. This is required for an efficient creation of PDF files, in package documentation or elsewhere.

- [x] Now, when you have the latest version of R, install Rtools, too. <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/>

- [x] Install the `usethis` and `devtools` packages with all their dependencies.  You should run `install.packages(“devtools”)` and see if all dependencies install without error. If not, you must figure out why some components are not installing.

### Connect to the Github collaboration platform via RStudio

- [x] Now install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), or, if you already have it, check if you have the latest version. (Help Menu, Check for Updates.)

- [x] If you haven't done so yet, create an account on Github, and on Windows I suggest to install the Github Client. If you already have a Github account, but you have not used it recently, or did not connect RStudio to it lately, you are likely to have to do it again.

- [ ] Github does not support password authentication since August 13, 2021. This means that you cannot synchronize your offline and online repository using your *username* and *password* combination. 

- [ ] You can no longer synchronize the repository on RStudio with a repository URL only. For example, to synchronize `https://github.com/rOpenGov/retroharmonize`, you must explicitly state on your computer to synchronize via this URI: `git@github.com:rOpenGov/retroharmonize.git`, which will require the use of a 

- [x] [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/) guides you through the process on Linux, Mac OS or Windows platforms.

### Handshake with us

- [ ] Run into a problem? We use the open-source and encyrpted, privacy-sensitive competitor of Slack, [Keybase](https://keybase.io/). You can ask for help in our [Keybase Community](https://keybase.io/team/reprexcommunity).

- [x] For any of our repositories that you would like to contribute to into your own Github profile, for example, [https://github.com/rOpenGov/retroharmonize/](https://github.com/rOpenGov/retroharmonize/) to *yourusername/retroharmonize*.  

- [x] Send a pull request when you have something to commit to our work.

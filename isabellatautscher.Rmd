## Hello, world!

Hi World :)

## Add a file to the png folder

Choose any png file that you like (and which is royalty free, not too big), and place it on your drive to the `/png/subfolder` of your local repository copy. The name of the png file should be changed below:

```{r yourpng, eval=FALSE}
# By the way this is how you include a png file as illustration from 
# ../png/<your_filename>.png
knitr::include_graphics(here("png", "<yourfilename.png>"))
# Set eval=TRUE when done. It is set to FALSE because  "<yourfilename.png>" does not exist.
```
